Computers with Windows have several programs that make Chinese computing an easy task. On Linux these are rather poor, especially hand writing characters is almost impossible.

I have written a small program called 'xpen' that makes it easy to hand write characters that are automatically send to the current program (for instance a text editor). Apart from this there is a dictionary (pinyin, characters / English) build in which is based on Cedict.

Usage:
Right click the top bar to open the options
Left click the bottom bar to open the dictionary
All buttons and entries have popup tips to make the program easy to use.

The program uses Glade for the users interface. The glade file or link to this file should be in the same directory as the application itself.

Please note that this is the first version of the program and small bugs will probably come up once in a while. On average use the program is functioning well however.

You are invited to use the code to make improvement.
